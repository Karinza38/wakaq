# WakaQ
Distributed background task queue for Python backed by Redis, a super minimal Celery.

## Features

* Queue priority
* Delayed tasks (run tasks after a timedelta eta)
* Scheduled periodic tasks
* Super minimal

Want more features like rate limiting, task deduplication, etc? Too bad, I won't accept feature PRs. Implement it yourself in your appâ€™s worker tasks.

## ToDo

* [x] scheduler
* [x] admin info inspection, purging queues, etc
* [ ] signals
* [ ] timeouts
* [ ] logging
* [ ] handle child process crash/exception and re-fork
* [ ] look into spawn instead of fork (https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#using-a-pool-of-workers)

## Example

```python
from wakaq import WakaQ

wakaq = WakaQ(
    queues=[
        (0, 'a-high-priority-queue'),
        (1, 'a-medium-priority-queue'),
        (2, 'a-low-priority-queue'),
    ],
)


@wakaq.task(queue='medium-priority-queue')
def mytask(x, y):
    print(x + y)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # add 1 plus 1 on a worker somewhere, overwriting the default queue from medium to high priority
    mytask.delay(1, 1, queue='hight-priority-queue')
```
